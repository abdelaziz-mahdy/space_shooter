            **TASK: Review PR and automatically create a fix PR**

            Please perform the following steps:

            1. **REVIEW THE PR:**
               - Read the PR using `gh pr view` and `gh pr diff`
               - Check code quality and best practices
               - Identify potential bugs or issues
               - Check performance considerations
               - Look for security concerns
               - Verify test coverage
               - Use CLAUDE.md for guidance on style and conventions

            2. **POST REVIEW COMMENT:**
               - Use `gh pr comment` to leave a detailed review comment
               - List all issues found with specific file:line references
               - Be constructive and helpful
               - Include severity (🔴 Critical, 🟡 Important, 🔵 Suggestion)

            3. **AUTOMATICALLY APPLY FIXES:**
               If you found ANY issues that can be fixed automatically:

               a. Create a new branch: `fix/auto-fix-pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}`
               b. Apply ALL the fixes following CLAUDE.md principles:
                  - Replace enums with classes
                  - Replace hardcoded values with percentages
                  - Fix any violations of coding principles
                  - If changes are client-facing: update pubspec.yaml version AND assets/changelog.json
               c. Commit changes with descriptive message
               d. Create a new PR using `gh pr create` with:
                  - Title: "Auto-fix: Address review issues from PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}"
                  - Body that includes:
                    * "🤖 **Automated fixes based on code review**"
                    * Summary of all changes made
                    * Reference to original PR: "Fixes issues found in #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}"
                    * List of specific fixes with file:line references
               e. Comment on the ORIGINAL PR with a link to the fix PR

            4. **END YOUR REVIEW COMMENT WITH:**
               "---
               ✅ **Automated fix PR created:** #[NEW_PR_NUMBER] (if fixes were applied)
               OR
               ✨ **No automated fixes needed** - please review the suggestions above (if only manual fixes)"

            IMPORTANT:
            - Follow ALL principles in CLAUDE.md
            - Only create fix PR if there are actual fixable issues
            - If uncertain about a fix, mention it in review but don't auto-fix it
            - Always run the fixes, don't just suggest them

          # or https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/cli-reference for available options
